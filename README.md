# News2Change
Identify news trends happening near you and across the country in a few clicks. Find contact information of local representatives for advocacy.

## Inspiration
We wanted to make advocacy more accessible to everyone.

## What it does
News2Change identifies news trends happening near you and across the country in a few clicks. Local representatives are also shown to make advocacy more accessible.

## How we built it
We utilized News API, Google Civic Information API, Geolocation API, and Javascript to build our app.

## Challenges we ran into
We initially had trouble extracting the location of the user, but we implemented a geolocation API that asks for the user's permission and successfully outputs the coordinates of the user.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
News2Change has the potential to reach a large range of users. Anyone who cares about the news can make an impact by contacting their local representatives about issues that matter to them.

## What we learned
Throughout the development of News2Change, we encountered many detours from our original plans. Many of these obstacles turned out to provide valuable advice on the website's design.

## What's next for News2Change
We plan to keep improving our user interface to make the website more user-friendly. We will also add more features to narrow down news articles to suit the user's preferences.
